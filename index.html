    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>Multilingual Language Identification</h3>
    <p>
        Built and evaluated a language identification system across 16 languages, including experiments with SentencePiece tokenization, balanced datasets, and code-switched evaluation sets.
    </p>

    <h3>Code-Switched Dataset Creation</h3>
    <p>
        Designed synthetic code-switched datasets with controlled language-pair combinations to evaluate robustness of language identification models.
    </p>

    <h3>Sentiment & Emotion Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Worked on sentiment analysis beyond polarity, including emotion detection such as empathy and politeness using both traditional ML and transformer-based models.
    </p>

   <h3>Topic Modelling</h3>
    <p>
        Applied topic modelling techniques to discover latent themes in large text corpora, using approaches such as LDA and contextual embeddings. Focused on topic interpretability, coherence evaluation, and real-world text noise.
