    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Data Scientist with hands-on experience in multilingual NLP, language
        identification, sentiment and emotion analysis, and robust model
        evaluation. I focus on building practical, well-evaluated machine
        learning systems with strong attention to error analysis, data quality,
        and real-world deployment challenges.

    <h2>Professional Projects</h2>

    <h3>Multilingual Language Identification <span>(Professional Project)</span></h3>
    <p>
        Built and evaluated a language identification system across 16 languages, focusing on balanced training data, tokenizer experimentation (SentencePiece), and robustness evaluation on code-switched and out-of-distribution text.
    </p>

    <h3>Code-Switched Dataset Creation <span>(Professional Project)</span></h3>
    <p>
        Designed synthetic code-switched datasets with controlled language-pair combinations and switching frequency to stress-test multilingual NLP models under realistic scenarios.
    </p>

    <h3>Sentiment & Emotion Analysis <span>(Professional Project)</span></h3>
    <p>
        Worked on sentiment analysis beyond polarity, including emotion detection such as empathy and politeness, using both traditional machine learning and transformer-based approaches in applied NLP settings.
    </p>

    <h3>Topic Modelling <span>(Professional Project)</span></h3>
    <p>
        Applied topic modelling techniques to discover latent themes in large text corpora using methods such as LDA and contextual embeddings, with emphasis on topic interpretability, coherence, and noisy real-world data.
    </p>

    <h3>End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline <span>(Professional Project)</span></h3>
    <p>
        Built end-to-end machine learning pipelines covering data cleaning, feature engineering, preprocessing pipelines, model training, evaluation, and reproducibility following industry best practices.
